# Candle-Shop-Web-Page
A demo web page for a Candle Shop of mine I made for my final project of Web Programming course.
I developed a website using ASP.NET MVC, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript technologies. The
website is designed as an e-commerce platform for selling handmade candles. As for the database
technology, although I had previously worked with MySQL, I wanted to try a different approach in this
project. Since I have been using SQLite in another project I am currently developing, called “Blog
Page,” I decided to use the same database technology here as well. SQLite's simplicity in setup and
suitability for small-scale projects were the main reasons for my preference. ATTENTION: I provided necesary SQL queries alongside the source code.These SQL queries consists of some fake passwords/emails like eileen@example.com, just to show that system works as it is designed to be. You can use these queries just to test the code that it is working.
